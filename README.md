# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore factors influencing passenger survival rates. By examining various attributes, such as passenger class, age, and sex, the analysis aims to identify key trends and insights regarding survival outcomes.

## Problem Statement
The Titanic disaster highlighted significant disparities in survival rates among different groups of passengers. This analysis seeks to answer the following questions:
- How does passenger class affect survival rates?
- What is the relationship between age and survival?
- Are there significant differences in survival rates between male and female passengers?

## Features
- Visualizations of survival rates by passenger class and age distribution.
- Statistical analysis using contingency tables and chi-square tests to determine the significance of findings.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values.
